# Feathers SDK Manager

The Feathers SDK Manager is an application that downloads the [Feathers SDK](http://feathersui.com/sdk/) and all of its third-party dependencies. The manager prepares the SDK for use with an IDE, like Adobe Flash Builder or IntelliJ IDEA. Developers may choose which version of the Adobe AIR and Adobe Flash Player runtimes to target.

The Feathers SDK Manager is supported on Mac OS X and Windows.
